          Information about this OpenSSL and this directory

11/21/2003: OH

This directory contains OpenSSL package. We build binary files
from source code, downloaded from www.openssl.org, and checkin
binary files under this directory for each platform.

  Source file: openssl-0.9.7c.tar
 
Our build steps and options used in build commands follow these
rules:

  1. Build and install in builder's local directory $HOME/local/openssl
  2. Multithread version is built
  3. Both static and shared library are built
  4. Assembly code is used in NT for better code performance
  5. Cipher RC-5 and IDEA are not included to avoid patent issue. If these
     are needed later, it should be rebuilt without option "no-rc5 no-idea".

To build the binary again, refer to following commands for Unix:

  % tar xvf openssl-0.9.7c.tar
  % cd openssl-0.9.7c
  % ./config --prefix=$HOME/local/openssl --openssldir=$HOME/local/openssl threads shared no-rc5 no-idea
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

You can then copy files from $HOME/local/openssl for output binary files and 
header files.

On Windows, we use VC++ 6.0 and Netwide Assembler (NASM) v0.98 (Downloaded
from http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/nasm/binaries/win32/) to build 
both static and dynamic versions of openssl:

  % tar xvf openssl-0.9.7c.tar
  % cd openssl-0.9.7c
  % perl Configure threads no-rc5 no-idea VC-WIN32
  % ms\do_nasm
  % nmake -f ms\nt.mak
  % nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak

The output files are under "out32" for static library version, and 
"out32dll" for dynamic library version. The header files are under
"inc32".

Warning: We experienced build failure when "Perl v5.6.1 built for cygwin-multi"
         was used on Win2K; "Perl 5.003 built for NT" was used to build on Win2K.

See http://www.openssl.org for documents.

To build the binary again, refer to following commands for Linux:

  % tar xvf openssl-0.9.7c.tar
  % cd openssl-0.9.7c
  % ./config --prefix=$HOME/local/openssl --openssldir=$HOME/local/openssl threads shared no-rc5 no-idea
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

NOTE: The Linux version under EL52 folder is build on RHEL 5.2(32 bit).

To build the binary again on RHEL 5.3, refer to following commands for Linux:

Step 0. Setup gcc to use -m32 by default:
  % sudo mv /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/gcc.64
  % sudo echo "gcc.64 -m32 $*" > /usr/bin/gcc
  % sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/gcc

Step 1. Untar openssl source code
  % tar xvf openssl-0.9.7c.tar
  % cd openssl-0.9.7c

Step 2. Using setarch to makes the compiler think it's in 32-bit env
  % setarch i386

Step 3. Configure & compile the source code
  % ./config -m32 --prefix=$HOME/local/openssl --openssldir=$HOME/local/openssl threads shared no-rc5 no-idea
  % make depend
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

NOTE: The Linux version under el53 folder is build on RHEL 5.3 64-bit with Nehalem processor using gcc 4.1.2 64-bit.
