	*: The result of operation (sign/verify) is returned in the
          list of xmlDSigSignature objects. Application can examine
	  the key and signature method, content just before digesting or
          signing, etc. and decide what to do with it.
	*: The Transform and KeyInfo code was significantly re-written and 
          separated from the XMLDSig code with a goal to reuse in in 
          XML Signature or whatever.
        *: Added support for RetrievalMethod and Manifests (pretty simple
	  adter the first change because both are based on Transforms)
        *: Added XSLT support (based on libxslt from Daniel Veillard)
