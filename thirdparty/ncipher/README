-------------
The program check-extract must be installed on VeriSign's frontend machines, where sophia.exe is running. The ncipher.conf must be put in directory $ECASINSTALL/config on the frontend machines also.

To install check-extract, first, create a directory $NCIPHER_HOME, such as /ecas/public/ncipher. And put the file there. Make sure the file mod is excutable and the 'NCipherModule' parameter in the ncipher.conf pointing to the right path. Second, create a 'tmp' dir under $NCIPHER_HOME. Change the directory mod to global read/write/execute. And make sure the 'TempDir' parameter in the ncipher.conf pointing to it.
