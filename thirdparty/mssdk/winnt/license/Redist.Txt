In a DOS window, enter:

     mdac_typ.exe /q:a /c:"setup.exe /qt"

The /q:a switch removes all user interfaces from the standalone wrapper.
The /qt switch removes all user interfaces from the MS installer.

=================================================
API functions relating to OLE Controls (OLEPRO32)
=================================================
OLEPRO32.DLL may be distributed royalty-free with an OLE Controls project.
One must, however, take the usual care when installing this DLL on a
system to ensure that it does not replace a potentially newer version
of the library.

Before attempting to install this DLL, ensure that a DLL of the same name
is not already present with a greater version number (as determined by the
version resources).

If you do install the DLL on a computer, you must also ensure that its
registry entries are properly created.  OLEPRO32.DLL is a self-registering
server, which means that it can create its own registry entries on
demand.  To perform this self-registration, the installation program must
execute the following code to call the standard export DllRegisterServer:

        // pszPathToInstalledDLL is the path+name of OLEPRO32.DLL

        HINSTANCE       hMod;

        if (FAILED(CoInitialize(NULL))) return 0;

        hMod=LoadLibraryA(pszPathToInstalledDLL);

        if (hMod > (HINSTANCE)HINSTANCE_ERROR)
            {
            HRESULT (STDAPICALLTYPE *pfn)(void);
            BOOL    fRes=FALSE;

            (FARPROC&)pfn=GetProcAddress(hMod, "DllRegisterServer");

            if (NULL!=pfn) fRes=SUCCEEDED((*pfn)());

            //
            // fRes indicates success or failure. The HRESULT from
            // (*pfn)() provides the specific error.
            //
            }

        FreeLibrary(hMod);
        CoUninitialize();

This will create the necessary registry entries for the standard font
and picture objects, among other things.

If you have an uninstaller program, you should call the exported
function DllUnregisterServer in the same way when removing the DLL from
the system.  This ensures registry cleanup.

OLEPRO32.DLL is located in the Platform SDK in \bin\win95.
It should be installed in the %windir%\system directory on Windows 95.  It
should never be installed on Windows NT 4.0.
