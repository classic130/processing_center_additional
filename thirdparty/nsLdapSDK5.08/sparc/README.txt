              iPlanet LDAP SDK for C, version 5.x
=================================================================
 
Documentation for this release of the LDAP SDK for C is located
at the following URL: 

   http://docs.iplanet.com/docs/manuals/directory.html#SDKC

The documentation set includes the "Release Notes" (in HTML
format) and the "Netscape LDAP SDK for C Programmer's Guide."
The Programmer's Guide is available in PDF and HTML formats.

Please note that the LDAP SDK for C library is most of the time
ahead of our official documentation.  For example, we currently 
don't have a 5.0 branded version of the documentation, however,
using the latest 4.1 version should be sufficient.

Portions of this LDAP SDK are also available in source code form
as part of the Mozilla.org open source project under the terms of
the Netscape Public License.  Please Refer to the following site
for more information on how you can get that source code:

Any terms of Sun's license agreement covering this LDAP SDK which
are different from the Netscape Public License are offered by Sun
alone and not by any other party.
