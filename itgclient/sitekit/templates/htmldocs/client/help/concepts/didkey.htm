When you communicate with another person (or computer), you need a way to exchange information
securely, so no one can intercept and read the information. Currently, the most advanced way 
to scramble (encrypt) data is through a system that uses key pairs. A key pair consists of a public 
and a private key. The keys are used similarly to keys in a lock, except the key pair requires one 
key to secure the lock and another to open the lock.

<P>

With key pairs, your software application uses one key to encrypt a document. The person who 
receives your encrypted document then must use the matching key to decrypt the message. The 
problem with this process is, how do you give someone the "key" to decrypt your message without 
allowing anyone else to get the key? 

<P>

The solution is in the way the keys are used. When you request a Digital ID, your Web browser 
creates both a private key, that can only be used with the Digital ID you requested, and a public key, that
becomes part of the Digital ID. The Web browser 
might ask you for a password to use when accessing the private key. It is very important that you 
choose a password that only you will know (not your birthday or other number or phrase someone 
is likely to guess). 

<P>

After you receive and install a Digital ID, you distribute it to whoever needs it. The Digital ID 
that you send contains your public key. When someone needs to send you an encrypted message, 
they use your public key. When a message is encrypted with your public key, you are the only 
person who can decrypt the message because only you have the matching private key.

<P>

Likewise, when you want to send someone an encrypted message, you must first get their public 
key. You do this either by looking up their Digital ID in a directory, or you simply have them send 
you a signed e-mail message, which contains their Digital ID and public key. Then your e-mail
application can automatically store the Digital ID until you need to use it.
