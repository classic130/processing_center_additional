You can acquire a Digital ID from a company called a Certification Authority (CA). Also, your
company or organization might issue you a Digital ID through the Digital ID Center in conjunction
with a CA.

<P>

When your company issues you a Digital ID, they are providing you with a way to identify yourself
to other people in the company, to your company's business partners, or to computers in your
network.

<P>

If you are getting a Digital ID for personal reasons, you should seriously consider who you want
to be your CA. When you need to prove your identity, you want a CA that others will trust. For
example, most people and companies trust the validity of a driver's license or passport. This is
because they trust the way the government issues these documents. However, a student ID is typically
accepted as proof of your identity only to the school that issues the ID. The same holds true
for Digital IDs. You want a Digital ID from a CA that is trusted by all major companies doing
business on the Internet.
