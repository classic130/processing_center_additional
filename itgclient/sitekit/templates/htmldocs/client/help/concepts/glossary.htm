</font><DD><font size="2" face="VERDANA, ARIAL, HELVETICA">Entity authorized to issue, suspend, renew, or revoke certificates.
CAs are identified by a
distinguished name on all certificates and CRLs they issue. A
Certification Authority (CA) must publicize its public key or
provide a certificate from a higher level CA attesting to the validity
of its public key. Symantec is a CA.
