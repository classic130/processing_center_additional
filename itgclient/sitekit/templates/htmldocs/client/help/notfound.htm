types of IDs are:</LI>

     <BR>
     <B>Valid</B> means the ID is current.


<!-- Not sure these features are in or not.
	<BR>
<B>Expired</B> means the ID is no longer valid because its validity period is passed. Digital IDs are
typically valid for one year.

<BR>

encrypt private communications.

<BR>
<B>Pending</B> means the ID has been generated, but it has not been picked up and installed by the

Identification Number that is sent to the e-mail address entered in the enrollment form.
