<H3 align=left>Deploying the Symantec MSI packages</H3>
<P align=left>Software contained within an MSI package can be deployed in the 
following ways:</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>Publish software to a user</STRONG> : When software is 
published to a user, it is made available to the user for installation via the 
Add/Remove Programs applet in the Control Panel the next time the user logs in. 
The user can launch the Add/Remove Program applet, click on Add New Programs and 
choose to add the published software. This will completely install the software 
on the user's machine. The user can be a non-power user and does not need 
special privileges to install published software.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>Assign software to a user : </STRONG>When software is 
assigned to a user, it is psuedo-installed the next time the user logs in. This 
means that the user is given the impression that the software has been installed but 
is only completely installed the first time the user tries to use the software. 
This feature provides an install on demand mode of installation. The user can be 
a non-power user and does not need special privileges to completely install 
assigned software.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>Assign software to a machine : </STRONG>When software is 
assigned to a machine, it is completely installed on the machine when the 
machine is rebooted. Once installed, the software is available to all users on 
that machine.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>Launching the MSI package : </STRONG>By double clicking 
the MSI package, a user can install the software contained within the MSI 
package. However the user needs to be an administrator on the machine where the 
installation is being launched in this mode. This mode does not require active 
directory or group policy support. </P>
<P align=left>Additional information about MSI 
      packages is available on the <A

<H3 align=left></A>Requirements </h3>
<P align=left>The first three modes of deployment require a Windows Server 2008/Windows 2012 domain 
with an Active Directory. The administrator of such a domain can specify how the 
software should be deployed (assigned to user/machine or published) by 
specifying a group policy. The end user machine where the software is installed 
must be one of the following : </P>
