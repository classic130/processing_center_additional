Many Web sites require users to enter a username and password before getting access to a site. 
While this is a widely used means of identifying users, this solution has several drawbacks: 

<P>
<UL>
   <LI>Passwords are often passed over the Internet without using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and can be easily compromised by someone intercepting public Internet transmissions. </LI>

   <LI>Password databases are expensive to support and maintain. Managing and maintaining a password implementation requires significant resources. InfoSecurity News estimates that even a simple password file of 5,000 entries takes 3,200 work-hours per year to maintain and support. Much of the expense is from supporting customers who have forgotten their passwords. </LI>

   <LI>Security weaknesses are inherent in a password system. Users must remember multiple username and password combinations, so they select obvious passwords or use the same password for multiple log-ins. Security can be enhanced by automatically assigning more secure, random passwords, but this results in an increase in customer service calls from users who cannot remember their passwords. </LI>

   <LI>All of the user names and passwords for a site must be stored in a single file. This password file is a single point of security failure and is susceptible to attacks, the success of which could be devastating to an organization. </LI>

   <LI>Password solutions offer no proof of who is actually using the password, which can result in password sharing and lost revenue potential. </LI>

   <LI>Passwords do not provide a means of preventing non-repudiation - the false denial that a message has been sent or a commitment made. A site cannot prove whether or not a user received an e-mail message, nor can a user prove that a site received information that he sent. </LI>
