This is a release of a subset of the JDK 2.1.1 source code.

The JCSI 2.1.1 Makefiles normally attempt to build the entire JDK 2.1.1 source 
base and would fail when only a subset was found.  This release contains 
versions of those Makefiles with the minimal modifications that were required
to produce a working default "make" (or "make all").  Note that many of the 
other targets in the Makefiles should NOT be expected to work with this subset.

The Makefiles expect the environment variable JAVA_HOME to specify the 
directory that contains a version of the JDK (e.g. /usr/java1.2 on Solaris).

We recommend using JDK 1.2.x for builds rather than JDK 1.3.x -- if you use 
JDK 1.3.x to build then the resulting classes will not run on JDK 1.2.x, 
because JDK 1.3.x generates references to java.security.interfaces.RSAKey,
which exists in JDK 1.3.x but not in JDK 1.2.x.

(Normally we use JDK 1.2.2 ourselves, because of a Javadoc bug with multiple 
"-link" options in JDK 1.2 and 1.2.1, but that isn't an issue for this subset).

The normal JCSI binary distribution and sample code generally expect you to 
modify jre/lib/security/java.security to add the JCSI provider(s) and perhaps
to set the default keystore type to PKCS12.  This source release does NOT
require you to make any such modifications in order to get it to build.

The current Makefiles do not dependency-based rebuilding;  they are more like 
a shell script that rebuilds everything that it is told to rebuild.  They also 
do not automatically clean out the ./lib/classes build area, so if you delete 
or move source files we recommend "make clean" before "make".  (The build 
system and the source structure are slated to be overhauled in a future 
release, most likely using Ant).  


Commitment levels of com.dstc.* packages
----------------------------------------

JCSI packages that are included in the public JCSI javadoc, e.g. at

		http://www.wedgetail.com/jcsi/2.1.1/apidocs/

are considered to be public APIs and should mostly evolve gracefully in
subsequent JCSI releases.

JCSI packages that are not included in the public JCSI javadoc are considered
private, and may change, be renamed, or be deleted in subsequent JCSI releases.
This category includes, among others:

			com.dstc.security.asn1
			com.dstc.security.certpath
			com.dstc.security.common
			com.dstc.security.keymanage...
			com.dstc.security.provider
			com.dstc.security.util
			com.dstc.security.x509...

Most of these packages have already changed substantially for JCSI 2.2.
