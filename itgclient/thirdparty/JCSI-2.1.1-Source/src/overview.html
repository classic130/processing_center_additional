<A HREF="http://www.wedgetail.com/jcsi/">JCSI</A>
is a Java cryptographic toolkit for JDK 1.2 and 1.3 with extensive support 
for commonly used cryptographic algorithms and protocols (including SSL, 
S/MIME and Kerberos).

<P>

JCSI is designed around the standard Java JCA/JCE architecture for
cryptography. Wherever possible it implements standard Java APIs;
namely, the JSSE API for SSL ({@link javax.net.ssl}) and the 
IETF GSS-API for Java ({@link org.ietf.jgss}). Where there
is no standard Java API currently available, JCSI defines and implements
its own; namely
the CMS ({@link com.dstc.security.cms}) 
and S/MIME ({@link com.dstc.security.smime}) APIs for secure messaging, the
Kerberos API ({@link com.dstc.security.kerberos}), 
and a PKI API ({@link com.dstc.security.pki}) for generating and managing 
X.509 certificates and CRLs).

<P>

JCSI is designed to support arbitrary Security Providers in a manner
intended by the JCA/JCE. It does however include all Security Providers
necessary for the protocols it supports. These include:

<ol>
   <li>A cryptographic Provider supporting RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman
       and various symmetric ciphers
   <li>A {@link java.security.cert.CertificateFactory}
       Provider for X.509 certificates and CRLs
   <li>A {@link java.security.KeyStore} Provider producing and accepting
       PKCS#12 formatted keystores.
</ol>

These can be replaced by suitable alternative Providers (if desired)
when using JCSI for its SSL, CMS, S/MIME or Kerberos/GSSAPI capabilities.
Configuration of Providers is covered <A HREF=../../setup.html>here</A>.

On the flip-side, the JCSI Providers can be used with third-party JCA/JCE
aware products (eg. Sun's keytool and jarsigner utilities). Details on
the JCSI Providers is available <A HREF=../JCSICryptoProvider.html>here.</A>

<p>
Sample JCSI usage is described in individual packages. Full-blown examples
are available for download from the JCSI
